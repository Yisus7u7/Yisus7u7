## A Note: 

I am a young man who is passionate about programming, it is my dream and I do not intend to leave it. 

I am currently going through a big family problem, my parents believe that programming is useless and does not produce anything for me. They are wrong, but I can't find a way to convince them. 

they broke my phone and other devices, and they want me to stay away from this, because according to them I am not gaining anything productive with this, because of that, currently I don't have a device with which I can continue my projects, so they I apologize for the updates I promised, I won't be able to keep up with all my projects for a long time, but I'll keep an eye out for your issues in my repositories.

Don't worry about me, I'll see how I overcome this situation, when I can I'll go back to programming and update my projects like termux-desktop among others. 

**Thank you if you took the time to read this, have a good day.**
